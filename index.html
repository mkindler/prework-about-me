      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Greetings! I'm new to the world of coding and look forward to taking on new challenges. Currently, I work full-time for the non-profit Big Brothers Big Sisters as a Senior Post-Secondary Success Coordinator. In addition to my full-time work, I spend part of my time working as a shopper for Instacart/Cub Foods fulfilling online grocery orders, and also pet-sit fairly regularly for friends and clients within the community. I recently adopted a kitten named Natsuko, and I think she has a strong interest in coding, too, as she's always walking across the keyboard editing my work. ;-)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Cycling, Running, Hiking, Pet-Sitting, Sewing</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Getting paid to ride my bike for miles and miles everyday... ;-)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Saint Paul, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To me, web development seems like a never-ending puzzle in a really fun way, but always with an end goal that you can see the results of whenever a project is completed.</p>
